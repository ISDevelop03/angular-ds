This makes it easy to build and review page states without\n      needing to navigate to them in your app. Here are some handy patterns for managing page data\n      in Storybook:\n    \n    \n      \n        Use a higher-level connected component. Storybook helps you compose such data from the\n        \"args\" of child component stories\n      \n      \n        Assemble data in the page component from your services. You can mock these services out\n        using Storybook.\n      \n    \n    \n      Get a guided tutorial on component-driven development at\n      \n        Storybook tutorials\n      \n      .
